- If possible add new feature like temperature (or other e.g. Industrial sales)
- Choosing Model: start with SVM later experiment with Prophet or other efficient model for prediction (regression)
- If unable to find features just continue, because there are a lot of data from 01-2019 till 09-2023 
- Because of large sample we can continue with less SVM with fewer features works worst but with large data we can achieve quite good result because its more efficient supervised learning
- On heat map features has good correlation
- On graph we also can see some correlation (e.g. sales and unemployment)
